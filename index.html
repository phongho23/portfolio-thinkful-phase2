          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>I received my B.S., Finance from the University of Florida, and M.S., Accounting from the University of Central Florida. </p>

          <p>I have always had a passion for tech ever since my dad introduced me to computers and all that they could do at 7 years old. </p>
          
          <p>For as long as I can remember, I have dreamt of making an impact on people's lives through technology.  The idea of being able to create and deploy products worldwide that people will use, touch, and better their lives with is amazing to me.
          </p>
          
          <p>If you're looking to hire a developer (or need a participant for a coding event), please don't hesitate to reach out.  I love coding, and am always excited to meet and learn from people in the industry!</p>
